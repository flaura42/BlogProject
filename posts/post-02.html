            <p>I've finished all the lessons for the first section! I was able to complete them in just a couple days, since so much was review. It would have been useful to know about Flex and Grid before I completed the MWS Nanodegree, but I figured it out. It is nice to see how things fit together in a structured order. Also glad to find out that combining Flex and Grid in a webpage <em>isn't actually weird</em>. I did it on a site I built, but it seemed like they were supposed to be either/or.</p>
            <p>And now I begin the first project...</p>

        <p class="about">I'm a Web Developer who is attempting to complete the <em>Front End Web Developer Nanodegree</em> in one month.  After completing the <em>Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree</em>, I realized there were some gaps in knowledge from being mostly self-taught.  This program is a good refresher and an excellent test of my determination.</p>
        <p class="about">Will I manage to complete it in 30 short days?  Stay tuned!</p>
