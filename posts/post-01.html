        <h2>My Very first post</h2>
        <p>Well, I did it.  I decided to attempt to finish this Front End Web Developer Nanodegree in one month.  Waaay too broke to be able to afford it.  I figured even if I don't complete it, working on it will be good for filling in the gaps.  Hopefully, I will manage to finish.</p>
        <p>Wish me luck!!</p>

          <h4>Who am I??</h4>
          <p>I'm a Web Developer who decided completing a Front End Web Developer Nanodegree in one month would be a good idea.  Although I have already completed the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree, I realized there were some web dev things I wasn't very familiar with from being self-taught.  I decided this program would be a good refresher for me and an excellent test of my determination.</p>
          <p>Will I manage to complete it in 30 short days?  Stay tuned!</p>
