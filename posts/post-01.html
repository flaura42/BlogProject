        <p>Well, I did it.  I decided to attempt to finish this Front End Web Developer Nanodegree in one month.  I figured even if I don't complete it, working on it will be good for filling in the gaps and a good refresher.  Hopefully, I will manage to finish.</p>
        <p>I sure am glad that Udacity is offering one free month!  It's a great way to spend time stuck at home during the pandemic and I'm waaay too broke to afford it.</p>
        <p>Wish me luck!!</p>

          <p>I'm a Web Developer who is attempting to completing a Front End Web Developer Nanodegree in one month.  After completing the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree, I realized there were some gaps in knowledge from being mostly self-taught.  This program is a good refresher and an excellent test of my determination.</p>
          <p>Will I manage to complete it in 30 short days?  Stay tuned!</p>
