            <p>I am working on the first project.  Trying to finish and submit it before bed tonight.  Hope I can make it!  I'm too much of a perfectionist and too stubborn to just use filler text.  I think it is turning out alright though. Still need to make sure I have covered everything in the rubric. The CSS requirements are forcing me to do it differently than I ordinarily would, but gotta follow the rules!</p>

        <p class="about">I'm a Web Developer who is attempting to complete the <em>Front End Web Developer Nanodegree</em> in one month.  After completing the <em>Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree</em>, I realized there were some gaps in knowledge from being mostly self-taught.  This program is a good refresher and an excellent test of my determination.</p>
        <p class="about">Will I manage to complete it in 30 short days?  Stay tuned!</p>
